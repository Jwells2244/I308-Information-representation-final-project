# I308-Information-representation-final-project
Collection of all of the work for the I308 Information representation Final project
Contains php, ERD, and database support for creating the database that is used with a sql script file. Important: the login elements
will not work because the table was originally populated by encrypting the passwords through php, and then inserting them.
In this final version, because you have to be logged in as joe to be able to add new employees, you will not be able to entirely
replicate this project, since you cant log in as joe when there is no one in the empLogins table.

A full-stack encapsulation of the entire Information Representation class at Indiana University
